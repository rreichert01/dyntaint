# Project Description
This repository contains the project completed as part of the Northwestern University course COMP_SCI 396-0 Special Topics in CS, focusing on the Dynamics of Programming Languages. The primary objective of this course is to familiarize students with the semantics of programming languages (PLs) and teach them how to construct mathematical models of PLs.

## Project Details
The specific project within this repository involves the implementation of operational semantics, as specified in the Microsoft Research Technical Report titled 'Dynamic Taint Tracking in Managed Runtimes.' The implementation of the operational semantics is carried out using Redex, a domain-specific language designed for creating mathematical models of programming languages.

## Course Overview
The course delves into the intricacies of programming language semantics, offering students insights into constructing precise mathematical models. The knowledge gained from this project contributes to a deeper understanding of the Dynamics of Programming Languages, with a focus on practical applications such as dynamic taint tracking in managed runtimes.

Feel free to explore the codebase and documentation for further insights into the implemented operational semantics and its relevance to the broader field of programming language dynamics.
